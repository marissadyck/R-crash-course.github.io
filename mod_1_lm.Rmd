#### Homogeneity of variance

We don't have any factor variables (groups) in our model so we wouldn't need to test this assumption but as an example we can use *year* which is a factor and run Levene's test on a model that predicts *damage* as a function of *year* and interpret the result.
```{r}

# Test assumptions ----------------------

leveneTest(residuals(glm(damage ~ year, data = cows, family = binomial), type = "deviance") ~ cows$year)

```

With Levene's test we are testing the null hypothesis that the groups have similar variance so we want a p > 0.05, but our value is 0.001 which would indicate we've violated this assumption.
