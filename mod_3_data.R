#  Module 3: Working with data

library(tidyverse)


# Working directories --------------------

# Find the directory you're working in 
getwd()          # note: the results from running this command on my machine will differ from yours!  


#  Import/Export data files into R with base R----------------------

# read.table to import text file (if no delim specified, it will try to guess!)
data.txt.df <- read.table("data/raw/data.txt")  



# Look at data by printing it in the console
# You can also look at data by using the View() function
# Or you can click on the object (data.txt.df) in your environment to view it
data.txt.df


# read.csv to import textfile with columns separated by commas
data.df <- read.csv("data/raw/data.csv")

#print data
data.df

# Remove redundant objects from memory
rm(data.txt.df)


  # Using Rs built-in data----------------------

# Look at all built-in data files
data()   


# read built-in data on car road tests performed by Motor Trend
data(mtcars) 

# inspect the first few lines
head(mtcars)   

# learn more about this built-in data set
# ?mtcars        


  # Basic data checking ----------------------

# ?str: displays the internal structure of the data object
str(mtcars)
str(data.df)



# get summary of the variables (columns) of a data object
summary(data.df)


# get summary info for a specific variable
summary(data.df$Import)


# Exporting data (save to hard drive as data file)

# ?write.csv: writes a CSV file to the working directory

# to save an entire data frame to your hard drive you would use the format below
# write.csv(data name in R, file = 'data name to save as.csv')

# however if we did this for data.df we would just be making a copy, instead we can export a subset of the data we just ran in
write.csv(data.df[, c("Country","Product")], # this tells R to save all rows for the 'Country' and 'Product' columns
          file = "data/processed/data_export.csv")   


# Working with data in R ------------------------

  # Assigning objects ----------------------

# <- assignment operator
# =  alternative assignment operator *avoid using this to assign objects to the environment

a <- 3     # assign the value "3" to the object named "a"
a = 3      # assign the value "3" to the object named "a" (alternative)
a == 3     # answer the question: "does the object "a" equal "3"? 


  # Boolean operations ----------------------

# Basic operators

# <    less than
# >    greater than
# <=   less than or equal to
# >=   greater than or equal to
# ==   equal to
# !=   not equal to
# %in% matches one of a specified group of possibilities

# Combining multiple conditions

# &    must meet both conditions (AND operator)
# |    must meet one of two conditions (OR operator)

Y <- 4
Z <- 6

Y == Z  #I am asking if Y is equal to Z, and it will return FALSE
Y < Z

!(Y < Z)  # the exclamation point reverses any boolean object (read "NOT")

# Wrong!
data.df[, 2] = 74     # sets entire second column equal to 74! OOPS WE GOOFED UP!!!

data.df <- read.csv("data/data.csv")  ## correct our mistake in the previous line (revert to the original data)!

# Right
data.df[, 2] == 74    # tests each element of column to see whether it is equal to 74

data.df[, 2] < 74 | data.df[, 2] == 91   # use the logical OR operator


  # Sub-setting data base R----------------------

# select those rows of data for which second column is less than 74
data.df[data.df[, "Import"] < 74, ]  

# select rows of data for which second column is greater than 25 AND less than 75

data.df[data.df[, 'Import'] > 25 & 
          data.df[, 'Import'] <75, ]

  # Summary statistics base R ----------------------

mean(data.df$Import)
sd(data.df$Import)


  # Packages----------------------

# Install packages 

# install.packages("tidyverse")


# Load packages to library 

library(tidyverse)


  # Package datasets ----------------------

ggplot2::diamonds   # note the use of the package name followed by two colons- this is a way to make sure you are using a function (or data set or other object) from a particular package... (sometimes several packages have functions with the same name...)



  # The wonders of tidyverse ----------------------

  # Read in tidy data ----------------------

tidy_data.txt <- read_delim('data/raw/data.txt')

# print data
tidy_data.txt


# check the object type of data

class(tidy_data.txt)


tidy_data.csv <- read_csv('data/raw/data.csv')

# print the first few rows of data
head(tidy_data.csv)


# in the console type
# rm(tidy_data.txt)
# rm(data.df)

  # Export tidy data ----------------------

# ?write_csv

# write_csv(data, 'data_name_to_save.csv')

  # The pipe operator ----------------------

# start by assigning a value to x
x <- 3

# call the variable x followed by %>% ('then')
x %>% 
  
  # calculate the log of x, 'then'
  log() %>% 
  
  # round the log of x to 2 digits
  round(digits = 2) 


# Data exploration with tidyverse ----------------------

# read turtle_data.txt in to R using readr
turtles.df <- read_delim('data/raw/turtle_data.txt',
                         delim = '\t') # specify tab-delimited file



# Renaming columns ----------------------

# check names of turtles data before changing
names(turtles.df)

turtles.df %>% 
  
   # set column names to lowercase
  set_names(
    names(.) %>%  # the period here is a placeholder for the data it tells R to use the element before the last pipe (e.g., turtles.df)
      tolower()) 

# check the names of turtles data
names(turtles.df)

rm(turtles.df)


# read turtle_data.txt in to R using readr

# Change variable type ----------------------

# Change sex to factor
