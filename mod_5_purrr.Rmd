## Iteration

Often times you will want to apply the same **function** or multiple **functions** to multiple **objects** or inputs this is called **iteration**. In **Base R**, **iterations** are achieved by using **for-loops**, which are cumbersome and not very intuitive. If you've taken an R class before and covered **for-loops**, you are probably already nervous. But do not fear Tidyverse has made a package to conduct **iteration** operations that is much more user-friendly... and it has a cute inviting name, *Purrr*

![](images/purrr_cat.jpeg)

Let's go through a few examples of how the *Purrr* package can be used

## Purrr map

As you can see from the [Purrr cheat sheet](cheatsheets/purrr_cheat_sheet.pdf), the *Purrr* package has a lot of usages. For the purposes of this course we will just be skimming the surface and mostly focus on applying **functions** with *Purrr* (upper left).

To apply the same **function/s** to a number of **objects** we use the `map()` **function**. 

Let's go through an example WITHOUT using *Purrr* first and then apply the **tidyverse** alternative.

### Intro to purrr

First let's generate a few random objects for us to work with
```{r}
test_object_1 <- c(1:10)

test_object_2 <- c(11:20)

test_object_3 <- c(21:30)
```

We just generated three vectors of 10 numbers each

Now let's say we want to extract the mean from each of these

The non-purrr way would be as follows
```{r}
# for first object
mean(test_object_1)

# object 2
mean(test_object_2)

# object 3
mean(test_object_2)
```
While relatively easy to do, you can imagine if you had many more objects to work with, copy and pasting this code would get annoying and likely to produce errors the more times you have to do it. 

Instead we can use *Purrr* to calculate the mean of all the objects at once

```{r}
#first supply all the objects in a list
list(test_object_1,
     test_object_2,
     test_object_3) %>% 
  
  # then use the map function with ~.x as a placeholder for all the objects before the last pipe (similar to '.')
  map(~.x %>% 
        
        # then supply the function/s
        mean())
```
Viola!

###The purrr process

Using *Purrr* might seem confusing at first, but it becomes second-hand nature once you have some practice, and by following these simple steps.

1. First, write out the code you would use to perform the desired operation for **A single object** 
2. Second, ensure that this code is formatted in a dplyr pipe style code chunk (e.g., supply the object first, followed by a pipe for each operation you wish to perform on the supplied object ) *AND* est that this produces the desired outcome with a single object 
3. Supply a list of objects *AND* transfer all of your piped functions inside of the purrr `map()` function, providing ~.x as a placeholder for your list (If only one operation is being applied you can use ~function(.x) instead. *I'll show you both approaches*

Let's try this process for a simple object manipulation




Step 1
```{r}
# code for one object
mean(test_object_1)
```

Step 2
```{r}
# now let's adjust this code so it's in a dplyr pipe format
test_object_1 %>% 
  
  mean()
```
>This step is crucial! If your existing code isn't already in dplyr format it will be much more difficult to transition to purrr

Step 3
```{r}
# instead of one object we supply a list
list(test_object_1,
     test_object_2,
     test_object_3) %>% 
  
  # then use the map function with ~.x as a placeholder for all the objects before the last pipe (similar to '.')
  map(~.x %>% 
        
        # then supply the function/s
        mean())
```


### Import data with Purrr

One of the most common ways I use *Purrr* is when I want to read in multiple data sets for the same analysis. Often times landscape data, weather data, species data, etc. will be entered separately but you need all the data files for an analysis. Importing data with purrr isn't as straighforward as other operations because there it isn't intuitive how to accomplish step 2. 

<span style="color: blue;">Start by reading in the 3 bobcat data files for this module, leave them named as they are<span style="color: blue;">

[bobcat_collection_data.csv](data/bobcat_collection_data.csv)

[bobcat_necropsy_data.csv](data/bobcat_necropsy_data.csv)

[bobcat_age_data.csv](data/bobcat_age_data.csv)

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}

bobcat_collection_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_collection_data.csv')

bobcat_necropsy_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv')

bobcat_age_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_age_data.csv')
```

Now lets do this using *Purrr*!

First we need to assign our object to the environment with a name. When we read in multiple data frames at a time they will be stored in a **list** object. **Lists** can be confusing to work with at first but they follow a similar structure to a **data frame**. Let's name this **list** *bobcat_data*.

And just like when we read in an individual data frame we need to provide the path for the data and the name and file extension (e.g. .csv, .txt.)

Then we were reference our purrr::map **function** AND the **function** we want to apply to all of the data. This is where things can get a bit confusing at first,

  - Inside the parentheses for for the *purrr::map* **function** we will reference the `read_csv()` **fuction**, BUT we must preface this **fuction** with a '~'. The '~' is part of the syntax Purrr uses.
  - Then where we would normally put the data file name we can substitute '.x' which will reference the data in the **list** we already provided. Similar to the '.' when using *dplyr*.

Let's look at an example
```{r}

# assign objects as list provide the names and file path of each data frame

bobcat_data <- list('data/raw/bobcat_collection_data.csv',
                    'data/raw/bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
                    'data/raw/bobcat_age_data.csv') %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    
    # this is alternative syntax you might see when only working with one function where the function is supplied after the '~' and '.x' is included in the function ()
    ~read_csv(.x)
  )

# look at the list structure
str(bobcat_data)
```

We can reduce our typing even further from the earlier example since all of the data are stored in the same folder by referencing a file path.

```{r}

# assign object name to environment and provide file path for the data
bobcat_data <- file.path('data/raw', 
  
  # provide the names of each data frame
  c('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
    'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
    'bobcat_age_data.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    ~read_csv(.x))

str(bobcat_data)
```

We could also format it like this if that makes more sense to you, using a period as the placeholder for the data file names
```{r}
# assign object name to environment and provide list of data file names

bobcat_data <- list('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
                    'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
                    'bobcat_age_data.csv') %>% 
  
  # provide file path for the data
  file.path('data/raw', .) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    ~read_csv(.x))

str(bobcat_data)
```

We can look at each **list** element by using the `$` similar to a data frame.

Let's see what are list elements are named using the `names()` argument.
```{r}
# first see what the list elements are named
names(bobcat_data)

```

hmmmm that's not ideal, our list elements don't have names. We can fix this by adding a 
**function** outside the `Purrrr::map()` to rename each object in the list.

```{r}

# assign object name to environment and provide file path for the data
bobcat_data <- file.path('data/raw', 
  
  # provide the names of each data frame
  c('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
    'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
    'bobcat_age_data.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    ~read_csv(.x)) %>% 
  
  # assign names to list objects
purrr::set_names('collection',
                   'necropsy',
                   'age')

str(bobcat_data)
```

Now we can look at each **list** element like by using the `$` 
```{r}
# look at the structure of the necropsy data
str(bobcat_data$necropsy)
```

Many of the columns read in improperly, we could tackle this individually for each dataframe, or we could include specification for the various column types in our `map()` function. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
# assign object name to environment and provide file path for the data
bobcat_data <- file.path('data/raw', 
  
  # provide the names of each data frame
  c('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
    'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
    'bobcat_age_data.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    ~read_csv(.x,
              
              col_types = cols(RearFoot_cm = col_number(),
                                  Tail_cm = col_number(),
                                  Ear_cm = col_number(),
                                  'Body_w/Tail_cm' = col_number(),
                                  Body = col_number(),
                                  Weight_kg = col_number(),
                                  Condition = col_number(),
                               Age = col_number(),
                       .default = col_factor())
              )) %>% 
  
  # assign names to list objects
purrr::set_names('collection',
                   'necropsy',
                   'age')

str(bobcat_data$necropsy)
```
If your data frames don't have all the same names of columns, which they usually don't, you will likely get a warning about parsing issues. You can ignore this just be sure to check the structure of each dataframe in your list before proceeding and ensure the variables you need later read in properly. 


### Format/manipulate data with Purrr

We can also use *Purrr* to manipulate our data. Recall I recommend always using lowercase for column names, objects, etc. The bobcat data when entered does not follow those rules so we'd want to change that after we import in R.

Let's look at the non-purrr way first and then see how much code repetition we avoid when we use *Purrr*. We would likely want to do this when we read in the data so, on your own <span style="color: blue;"> copy the non-purrr code from above where we read in the data, and set the column names to lowercase for each data set.<span style="color: blue;">

<span style="color: blue;">Use the `head()` function to look at the first few rows of each data set.<span style="color: blue;">

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}

bobcat_collection_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_collection_data.csv') %>% 
  
  # set names to lowercase
  set_names(
    names(.) %>% 
      tolower())

head(bobcat_collection_data)

bobcat_necropsy_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv')%>% 
  
  # set names to lowercase
  set_names(
    names(.) %>% 
      tolower())

head(bobcat_necropsy_data)

bobcat_age_data <- read_csv('data/raw/bobcat_age_data.csv')%>% 
  
  # set names to lowercase
  set_names(
    names(.) %>% 
      tolower())

head(bobcat_age_data)
```

That's a lot of repetition in our code, which we generally want to avoid whenever possible. With *Purrr* we can do just that. 

We are going to use the same code from above that we used to read in the data files using a file path, and we will add a **function** to set the column names to lower case.

To do multiple **iterations** within the same `purrr::map()` **function** we have to change one thing. Instead of typing a '~' before the `read_csv()` **function** and referencing our list (.x) inside the `read_csv()` **function** we need to reference the list elements first and then supply the multiple **funcitons** we want to apply.

See below
```{r}
# assign object name to environment and provide file path for the data
bobcat_data <- file.path('data/raw', 
                         
                         # provide the names of each data frame
                         c('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
                           'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
                           'bobcat_age_data.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    
    # reference list elements with ~
    ~.x %>% 
      
      # read in list elements   
      read_csv(col_types = cols(RearFoot_cm = col_number(),
                                  Tail_cm = col_number(),
                                  Ear_cm = col_number(),
                                  'Body_w/Tail_cm' = col_number(),
                                  Body = col_number(),
                                  Weight_kg = col_number(),
                                  Condition = col_number(),
                               Age = col_number(),
                       .default = col_factor())
            ) %>% 
      
      # set names to lower case
      set_names(
        names(.) %>% 
          tolower())
  ) %>% 
  
  # assign names to list objects
purrr::set_names('collection',
                   'necropsy',
                   'age')

head(bobcat_data$bobcat_collection)
```

I also don't like the column name for 'bobcat ID number'. See how it reads in with '' because someone used the '#' instead of typing number and R doesn't like that. Let's change this in all the data sets using *Purrr*.

For this example we won't go through the non-purrr way to save time
```{r}
# assign object name to environment and provide file path for the data
bobcat_data <- file.path('data/raw', 
                         
                         # provide the names of each data frame
                         c('bobcat_collection_data.csv',
                           'bobcat_necropsy_only_data.csv',
                           'bobcat_age_data.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once
  purrr::map(
    
    # reference list elements with ~
    ~.x %>% 
      
      # read in list elements   
      read_csv(col_types = cols(RearFoot_cm = col_number(),
                                  Tail_cm = col_number(),
                                  Ear_cm = col_number(),
                                  'Body_w/Tail_cm' = col_number(),
                                  Body = col_number(),
                                  Weight_kg = col_number(),
                                  Condition = col_number(),
                               Age = col_number(),
                       .default = col_factor())
            ) %>% 
      
      # set names to lower case
      set_names(
        names(.) %>% 
          tolower()) %>% 
      
      # change bobcats id# to better name
      rename(.,
             'bobcat_id' = 'bobcat_id#') # new name = old name
  ) %>% 
  
  # assign names to list objects
  purrr::set_names('collection',
                   'necropsy',
                   'age')

head(bobcat_data$collection)

```

Much better! 



## Purrr imap

### Saving data

Now that we have tidy data sets we may want to save these to our hard drive so we don't have to run code to reformat them every time we read in the data. 

<span style="color: blue;">In your script, type code that will save each of the data sets in the bobcat_data list as a csv to the data/processed folder. <span style="color: blue;">

```{r eval=FALSE}
# save each data set as a csv
write_csv(bobcat_data$collection,
          'data/processed/bobcat_collection.csv')

write_csv(bobcat_data$age,
          'data/processed/bobcat_age.csv')

write_csv(bobcat_data$necropsy,
          'data/processed/bobcat_necropsy.csv')
```

Now the *Purrr* way!

We can use the *Purrr* **function** `imap()` because it retains the names of elements within our list (.y) when we save them
```{r}
# save each data set as a csv
purrr::imap(
  bobcat_data,
  ~write_csv(.x,
             file = paste0("data/processed/",
                           .y,
                           '.csv')))
```

So much less repetition and code if you have a lot of data sets to save


###Figures

If you've done assignment 4, you may have been annoyed with how much code repetition there was to generate all the histograms for your explanatory variables. But not to fear, *Purrr* is here!

We can use *Purrr's* `imap()` function to quickly generate several of the same plot without having to copy and paste a bunch of code.

<span style="color: blue;">In your script attempt to make histograms for all the numeric variables in the necropsy data following the 3 steps I outlined earlier</span>

```{r}

# step 1: code for 1 histogram
hist(bobcat_data$necropsy$rearfoot_cm)

# step 2: translate code to dplyr pipe format
bobcat_data$necropsy$rearfoot_cm %>% 
  
  hist()
  
# step 3: provide list and pipe into `map()`
bobcat_data$necropsy %>% 
  
  # select only numeric vars
  select(is.numeric) %>% 
  
  # apply purrr::map
  map(~.x %>% 
        #provide histograms
        hist()
  )

```

>Likely your hiistrograms print without the variable name in the title, which we probably want to know what we are looking at

We can accomplish this with imap


<span style="color: blue;">First figure out how you would add a main title to a single plot </span>

```{r echo=FALSE}
?hist()

bobcat_data$necropsy$rearfoot_cm %>% 
  
  hist(main = paste('Histogram of', 'rearfoot_cm' ))
  
```
Once you've done that try adapting this for purrr
```{r}

bobcat_data$necropsy %>% 
  
  # select only numeric vars
  select(is.numeric) %>% 
  
  # apply purrr::map
  imap(~.x %>% 
        #provide histograms
        hist(main = paste('Histogram of', .y))
  )
```


## Purrr Map_dfr and map_dfc

*Purrr* also has a handy function to row-bind and column-bind data when you read it in. This is particularly useful when working with large data sets or data collected over several years.

For example if I had two years of bobcat necropsy data that were entered and saved as separate csv files, I could read them each in individually and then rowbind them together and save this new data frame to my environment to work with later as I've done below

```{r}
# read 2019 data
bobcat_necropsy_2019 <- read_csv('data/raw/sample_bobcat_necropsy_data_2019.csv')

# read 2020 data
bobcat_necropsy_2020 <- read_csv('data/raw/sample_bobcat_necropsy_data_2020.csv')


bobcat_necropsy_rbind <- rbind(bobcat_necropsy_2019,
                               bobcat_necropsy_2020)

head(bobcat_necropsy_rbind)
```
As we can see by looking at the objects in our environment or viewing the data this indeed joined the 2019 data with 2020. But there is a much faster way, especially if you have lots of data files.

Here we use the `map_dfr()` function in *Purrr* to simultaneously rbind our data frames when we read them in. This code mimics how you would read in multiple data frames into a list except the function will automatically try to rowbind them instead. 

For this to work the columns in the data frame must have the same column type (e.g., character, number, factor etc.) So I've also added code to specify how to read in the various columns otherwise we will get an error message.

```{r}
bobcat_data_dfr <- file.path('data/raw', 
                             
                             # provide the names of each data frame
                             c('sample_bobcat_necropsy_data_2019.csv',
                               'sample_bobcat_necropsy_data_2020.csv')) %>% 
  
  # use purrr::map to read in all data at once and rowbind them
  map_dfr(~.x %>% 
            read_csv(.,
                     
                     col_types = cols(RearFoot_cm = col_number(),
                                      Tail_cm = col_number(),
                                      Ear_cm = col_number(),
                                      'Body_w/Tail_cm' = col_number(),
                                      Body = col_number(),
                                      Weight_kg = col_number(),
                                      Condition = col_number(),
                                      .default = col_factor())))
```
Now instead of individual data frames or a list object that we have to rbind, in one chunk of code we've read in the data and rbdin it so we have a single data frame to work with!

If you have several data files that you want to join via column-bind you can also use `map_dfc()` with similar coding as above to join data frames in this way. **But be careful, this function assumes that the rows in each file are in the same order and nothing is missing or mismatched, so you can easily get errors if that isn't the case**. The *join* functions we covered earlier are a much safer option because you can specify a 'key' to ensure the rows are matched up properly, but it does take more coding.


>We've only barely scratched the surface of what *Purrr* can do, but given our limited time that is where we will end. Just remember anytime you find yourself repeating the same operations for multiple **objects** of the same type you may want to consider using *Purrr* instead to reduce repetition in your code.
