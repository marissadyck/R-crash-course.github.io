## Submission

Brightspace/TBD   

## Grading

> You should always be following best coding practices (see Intro to R module 1) but especially for assingment submissions.

To receive full credit for each assignment   

* Please make sure each problem has its own header so that I can easily navigate to your answers 
* Ensure you have comments that explain what you are doing   
* Long code chunks should be broken up with spaces and comments to explain what is happening at each step    
* Object names should be lowercase and short but descriptive enough that they aren't confused with other objects *(For example data1 and data2 are not good names for dataframes you are working with)*    
* Just because your code runs doesn't mean it did what you think it did, always check your data/objects to ensure any functions were performed correctly (there are several ways to do this)
